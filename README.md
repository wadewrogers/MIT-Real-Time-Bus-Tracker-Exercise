# MIT-Real-Time-Bus-Tracker-Exercise
MIT Exercise in understanding API's and Array manipulation to create a real time tracking website based on live data. 

This repository is using two API's
  - mapbox.com
  - mbta.com (Massachusetts BayTransportation Authority)

No Token is needed for the mbta API. 

However you will need to retreive a token from mapbox.com by signing up for site and going to your account settings page.
  1. Once you clone this repository you will need to use node.js and install dotenv.
  2. Create .env file and set your token in this file to MAPBOX_TOKEN = your_api_token

Potential future improvements would be to add the individual transit stations and include a count down on each bus with an estimated time of arrival.
